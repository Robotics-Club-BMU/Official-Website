## Robotics Club BMU
Robotics Club is to provide students a place to pursue their interest in both mechanical, electronic, and computer science by working on large and small-scale robotics projects. The club is open to students with and without experience in engineering and programming. Teams within the club will design, build, and program functioning robots using a variety of resources. We offer students a variety of workshops so that they are able to learn and explore. It is a place for all tech enthusiasts to explore their interests and capabilities. They would be taught by peers as well as the technical expertise in this field.

Our goal is to encourage students to design accessible, innovative projects that build self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills while motivating young people to pursue opportunities in science, technology, and engineering. Opportunities may include outside competitions such as techfest IIT BOMBAY, the world robotics championship (TECHNOXIAN), and inside competition within the campus.

## Contributing to this Repo

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/website) repository.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/project_name.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd Official-Website
```

**4.** Creating a new branch (IMP)
This is one of the very important step that you should follow to contribute in Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not creates a mess. To create a new branch:

```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

**5.** Make changes in source code.

**6.** Stage your changes and commit

```bash
# Add changes to Index
git add .

# Commit to the local repo
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**8.** Create a [Pull Request/PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) !
